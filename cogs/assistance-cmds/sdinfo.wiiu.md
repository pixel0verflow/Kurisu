The minimum SD card requirements for Wii U homebrew is 2GB, and **must** be FAT32 with an MBR partition table.

The recommended size is 32GB, you can typically use any size under that. The maximum size limit is 2TB. 

Buy SD cards from reputable brands (SanDisk, Samsung, Kingston, etc.). Preferably, purchase cards from a brick and mortar store near you, but Amazon is okay if you must purchase online. __**NEVER**__ buy cards from AliExpress, Temu, eBay or other similar sites.

Speed is irrelevant for the Wii U - it is limited to Class 3 (30MB/s) speeds. The only reason to buy a faster SD card is for faster data transfer to your computer.
